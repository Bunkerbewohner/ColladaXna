ColladaXna - COLLADA Importer for XNA 4.0
=========================================

**ColladaXna** is a .NET library for loading COLLADA (.dae) models with XNA 4.0, written in C#.

At its core is the Assembly _ColladaXnaBase_ which contains the class _ColladaModel_ which can be used to load ".dae" files. This works from within XNA content pipeline extensions just as well at run-time in applications and games using the .NET 4 Client Profile.

The Assembly _ColladaXnaImporter_ contains the _COLLADA Standard Importer_ which imports the Collada model into the default XNA content format which can be processed and loaded with XNA's default classes.
